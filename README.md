# Solar Smasher


This upload is of my final version of Solar Smasher which was uploaded in May 2017 as part of my final year project.
Solar Smasher is an educational video game which uses cognitive methods to educate the younger generation of the wonders of space.

This repository contains all of the assets used when developing Solar Smasher such as images and scripts for example.

You can download and play the final version without having to download these contents by visiting the following link:
